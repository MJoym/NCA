# Neural Cellular Automata 
An unofficial implementation of the paper [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/) in PyTorch.

## Additions and Changes to Model
Our goal was to determine if training the model on one or more images every iteration would enable it to generate new images that it hadn't "seen" before.



### References:
This is a pytorch implementation of the model described in this [paper](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/).
